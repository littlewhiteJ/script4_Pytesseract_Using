# script4_Pytesseract_Using

**it is only a script for using pytesseract quickly, nothing advanced!**

- put your pictures(with words) into dir <./image/>

- then run ocr.py

- text will be in dir <./txt/> 

- and threshPic of your pictures will be in dir <./threshPic/> 

we did color2gray and thresh to make the OCR more precise

the dir name can be changed in 'config.json'
